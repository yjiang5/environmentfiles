The configurations for working environment, so that I will not lose them anymore.

The IRC bouncer requries the tsocks + znc. The tsocks is for the proxy and znc is the real bouncer. Please notice that:
a) The pidgin is not working well with the znc as stated in http://wiki.znc.in/Pidgin.
b) The tsocks is not on the official repo yet, so we need download the rpm and yum localinstall. I have to use tsocks rpm for rele6 on centos 7 host environment.
